#Removed Server File
#Added main to all services
#Created Infrastructure Package
#Client stays the same simply getting quotes and printing them
#LocalBroker now main file to start
#Added command line arguments to Local Broker, and all services
#This is so it does not neccessarily have to run on localhost/1099
#If no commands given, runs on localhost and 1099
#Removed Service Registry and Service File
#All Services have a main method
#This is so each service can bind their service to the registry
#First lookup with getRegistry, then use registry.bind to put up their service
#Client now only require Broker to run
#Each service can be deployed individually, in any order
