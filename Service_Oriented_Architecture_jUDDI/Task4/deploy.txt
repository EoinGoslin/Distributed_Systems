1. Initial Configurations - donwload jUDDI distro 3.5.5 and jUDDI client distro 3.5.5
Link can be found here: http://archive.apache.org/dist/juddi/juddi/3.3.5/

I had to use a different distro so included that in the folder
I also had to run the startup.sh with the following command as would not work on my system.

Step1: cd into juddi-distro-3.5.5 folder
Step2: cd into juddi-tomcat-3.5.5
Step3: cd into bin
Step4: ./startup.sh

--------------------
	or
--------------------
	
JRE_HOME=/usr ./startup.sh


/*
***JRE_HOME=/usr ./startup.sh
*/
This command starts tomcat server.

/*
*However, 
****"./startup.sh" works on most computers straight away.
*/

If still does not work, I had to show my tomcat where my JDK was by adding a line into the bashRC file which exported its path. My path was this:

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64

I placed this line at the bottom of the bashRC file.



2. Running Solution - OPEN BASICQUOTESERVICE AS A PROJECT in Eclipse

Step1 - Adding Jar files if not automactically present in project

i)Open Eclipse or whatever IDE and open BasicQuoteService in Task4 as a project
ii) right click on BasicQuoteService
iii)Click Properties
iv)Select Java Build Path
v)Go to libraries
vi)Highlight all and click Add Jars

I downloaded these Jar files so org.apache imports would work


Step2:
As services will not be jUDDI initially, Each service can be run independantly to create them

Step1. Run all four services - No duplicate Business will be created
Step2. Run Run Client
